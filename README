		Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment

		Version 0.9.2

*******************************************************************

Introduction

This piece of software was written as a replacement and extension
for Tripwire. Tripwire is an excellent program in itself but lacks
some features and is a closed product.

Current Features:
Multiple integrity checking algorithms (Even more with mhash support)
Ability to output the database to stdout/file
Easy configuration through a powerful configuration file
Compressed databases(zlib support)
Lots of others. see docs.

Planned Features and TODO list:
Multiple database retrieval backends
Encrypted databases
Return Codes
Email report
More elaborate report options
Recurse=n
Interactive db update
Is file really deleted or has the config changed.
Rewrite for smaller memory footprint.
Localization
Relative paths in databases
Checksum of the binary at the start of the report
PGP support
@@ifdef foo || ( bar && baz )
Use newer autoconf
Release more often


Documentation 

Documentation is in doc/ directory. 
The manual pages are a good place to start.

Requirements

Once compiled aide is an independent program it does not need
any shared libraries or other programs to function.

Currently AIDE requires the following software to compile.
A C-compiler (such as GCC)
GNU flex 
GNU yacc 
GNU make
MHASH: http://mhash.sourceforge.net/

To compile you have to give the following commands:
tar zxvf aide-version.tar.gz	To unpack the archive
cd aide-version			Cd to the newly created dir
./configure --help		To see what configuration options are
				available
./configure [some options]	To configure the compilation
				The options are optional.
make				Do the actual compilation.
make install			Install the sofware.
				You do not have to do this.
				You should instead put it on read-only
				media or otherwise secure the binary.

To do development work you should have recent versions of:
automake
autoconf
autoheader
